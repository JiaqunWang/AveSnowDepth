# AveSnowDepth
The software uses the daily snow depth data in NASA Earth Data set from 1982 to 2021 to compute the average snow depth data in the conterminous US. The software can obtain the daily average snowfall data for a specific location within a particular period by entering the latitude and longitude, and time information.

The Location Map section shows the geographic location of the current input latitude and longitude. Users can check the current location of the data point by entering the longitude and latitude data in the Input module and then clicking the Verify Location option.

The Average Snow Depth plot graphically shows the average snow depth for each day of the year.

The Average Snow Depth data table contains the average snow depth data for each day from the first day to the three hundred sixty-fifth day. Users can quickly view the average snowfall data for a specific day by using the Month and Day columns.

The two options for the Processing method in the input section represent the choice of processing method. The "Single" option indicates that we are currently only dealing with average snowfall data for individual locations. The "Multiple" option indicates that we will calculate the snowfall data of multiple locations at the same time through multiple processing cores. This feature is still under development.

The End year column in the input data column represents the final year of the analysis. The Time Distance blank indicates the number of years that need to be average. For example, if the user wants to calculate the average snowfall data for the two-year period from 2019 to 2021, the user needs to enter 2021 in the End year column and 2 in the Time Distance column. After entering all the necessary data, the user can Click the "Single location" option to compute the average snowfall data for a single location.

After the calculation is done, the user can view the visualized data and use "Copy data to Clipboard" to copy the data to the clipboard. Finally, users can paste this data into an excel file. Again, the multi-location processing option is still a work in progress. But the user can still click these buttons, which will pop a message box to the user right now.

In the information bar, the user can scroll to see the information related to the single location processing option. Finally, the user can click the LinkedIn button to view the author's LinkedIn home page or click the Earth Data button to view the software's data sources.
